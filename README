Mimimalistic Simulink Coder Target for Linux
============================================

The aim of this target is to allow Simmulink to generate code that
runs in real-time on Linux. This target tries to be minimalistic in
the sense that it reuses as much as possible from Simulink built-in
targets.


Installation
------------

In Matlab prompt execute:

  cd <root>/ert_linux/ert_linux
  ert_linux_setup

From now on, Code Generation pane of Simulink Model Configuration
Parameters should offer ert_linux.tlc as System Target File (after
pressing "Browse...." button).
